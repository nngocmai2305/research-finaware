# FinAware

**FinAware** is a research-informed decision-awareness tool for students.

This prototype helps users explore the financial trade-offs involved in everyday decisions through simple, transparent calculations. It is *not* a predictive or recommendation system.

## Problem Addressed

Many students make financial decisions without fully understanding trade-offs like time, opportunity cost, or goal prioritization. FinAware models these trade-offs to support reflective learning.

## How It Works

Users input:
- Monthly income/allowance
- A list of expenses (needs vs wants)
- Personal goals (optional)

They can explore scenarios such as:
- Buy now vs Save
- Work hours vs Free time

The app provides simple, transparent calculations and prompts reflection, without prescribing actions.

## Installation (Local)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nngocmai2305/research-finaware.git
